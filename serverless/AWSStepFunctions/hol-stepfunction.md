![image](../../images/hol_stepfunction_lambda_ses_sns.png)
Log in to the AWS Management Console using the credentials provided on the lab instructions page. Be sure to use an incognito or private browser window to ensure youâ€™re using the lab account rather than your own.

Note: Make sure you're in the N. Virginia (`us-east-1`) region throughout the lab.

Open the lab's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JulieElkinsAWS/LALabs)  in a second tab. All of the code needed to complete this lab is available there.

## Create the Lambda Functions
1. In the GitHub repo, click on the file, ```email_reminder.py``` to open it.

2. Create Lambda function using this code
    * **Function name**: email
    * **Runtime**: **Python 3.8**

## Verify an Email Address in Simple Email Service (SES)
1. Go to **Amazon Simple Email Service** 

2. In the Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) console, Click the three horizontal line icon in the top left and choose **Verified identities**.

3. Click **Create identity**.

4. Choose **Email address**, enter your personal email address (or an email address you created specifically for this hands-on lab). Click **Create identity**.

5. In a new browser tab or email client, navigate to your email, open the Amazon SES verification email, and click the provided link.

    > **Note**: Check your spam mail if you do not see it in your inbox.

    You should see a **Congratulations**! page that confirms you successfully verified your email address.

6. Return to the AWS SES console tab.

You should now see **Verified** under **Identity status**. (**Note**: You may need to refresh the page.)

## Finish the email Lambda Function Setup
1. Return to the Lambda console in your first tab.

2. Within the `lambda_function` code, on line 3, delete the `YOUR_SES_VERIFIED_EMAIL` placeholder, and type in the email you just used, making sure to leave the single quotes around it.

3. Click **Deploy** in the **Code source** menu bar above the code.

    Your changes have now been deployed.

4. Scroll up on the same page to the **Function Overview** section, and copy the **Function ARN **by clicking the copy icon next to it, and paste it into a text file for later use in the lab.

## Create the sms Lambda Function
1. Create lambda function using code `sms_reminder.py`
    **Function name**: sms
    **Runtime**: **Python 3.8**


Scroll up on the same page to the Function Overview section, and copy the Function ARN by clicking the copy icon next to it, and paste it into a text file for later use in the lab. Keep this tab open.

## Create the `api_handler` Lambda Function
1. Create lambda function using code `api_handler.py`
    * **Function name**: _api_handler_
    * **Runtime**: **Python 3.8**



## Create a Step Function State Machine
1. Open the AWS Step Functions console in a new tab by typing _Step Functions_ into the search bar at the top of the screen. Right-click **Step Functions** from the drop-down menu, and select **Open Link in New Tab**.

2. In the AWS Step Functions console tab, click **Get started**.

6. Click the ```step-function-template.json``` file to open it.

7. Click **Raw** above the code to display the raw function code.

8. Copy all of the code to your clipboard.

9. Return to the Step Functions console tab, and paste the code on the left side of the screen.

10. On lines 33 and 49, replace the ```EMAIL_REMINDER_ARN``` placeholder value with the copied ARN for ```email``` that you should have copied over onto a text file earlier, being sure to leave the double quotes around the ARN.

11. On lines 38 and 59, replace the ```TEXT_REMINDER_ARN``` placeholder value with the copied ARN for ```sms```.

    You should now see the updated function diagram show up to the right of the code.

12. Click on the **Config** tab.

13. Leave the default name **MyStateMachine**.

14. Under **Permissions**, click the dropdown and select **RoleForStepFunction** under **Existing roles**.

15. Scroll down, and click **Create**.
